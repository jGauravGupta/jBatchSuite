jBatch Suite allows the developers to design java batch application model and automates Java code generation(Java Batch 1.0) . Batch processing is typified by bulk-oriented, non-interactive, background execution. Frequently long-running, it may be data or computationally intensive, execute sequentially or in parallel, and may be initiated through various invocation models, including ad hoc, scheduled, and on-demand.
