        A <b>CheckpointAlgorithm</b> implements a custom checkpoint policy for a chunk step. It is a child element of the chunk element. It is valid when the chunk element checkpoint-policy attribute specifies the value 'custom'.
       A custom checkpoint algorithm may be used to provide a checkpoint decision based on factors other than only number of items, or amount of time.
